# CS526_proj -- Forcasting Quaterly GDP

Accurately forecasting recessions is more important than ever, as financial institutions and policymakers grapple with concerns about the U.S. economy potentially entering a downturn. Traditional methods, often reliant on historical trends and lagging indicators, can lead to delayed responses—like those observed during the 2008 financial crisis. Our project seeks to address this by utilizing up-to-date macroeconomic data and novel alternative sources, such as Google Trends, combined with leading indicators like housing starts, to predict the likelihood of a U.S. recession within the next three months. By focusing on real-time insights, we aim to create a forecasting tool that enhances timely decision-making and helps shape more effective economic policies.
