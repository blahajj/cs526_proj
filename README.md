# CS526 Project -- Forcasting Quaterly GDP

Accurately forecasting recessions is more important than ever, as financial institutions and policymakers grapple with concerns about the U.S. economy potentially entering a downturn. Traditional methods, often reliant on historical trends and lagging indicators, can lead to delayed responsesâ€”like those observed during the 2008 financial crisis. Our project seeks to address this by utilizing up-to-date macroeconomic data and novel alternative sources, such as Google Trends, combined with leading indicators like housing starts, to predict the likelihood of a U.S. recession within the next three months. By focusing on real-time insights, we aim to create a forecasting tool that enhances timely decision-making and helps shape more effective economic policies.
